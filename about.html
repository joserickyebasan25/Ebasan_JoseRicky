      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I’m a 3rd-year Information Technology student with a growing passion for solving real-world problems through software development. My academic focus includes web systems, database management, and network fundamentals, but what drives me most is building practical solutions that improve user experience and efficiency.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the past semesters, I’m continuously learning new technologies to strengthen my full-stack development skills. I enjoy working on both the technical and logical aspects of IT, from designing structured databases to implementing clean, responsive user interfaces.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond coursework, I’m interested in <b>cybersecurity</b> and <b>data-driven systems</b>, and I plan to pursue these fields after graduation. I value collaboration, attention to detail, and lifelong learning, because technology never stops evolving, and neither should I.
